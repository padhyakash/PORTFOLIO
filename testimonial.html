    <p>"Not only was Akash’s work on-time and to spec, he pays attention to improve the aesthetics of the site as well as the functionality. Throughout the entire process he is responsive, and willing to work through issues as they arise. It’s obvious he takes tremendous pride in his work, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend or work with him again."</p>
